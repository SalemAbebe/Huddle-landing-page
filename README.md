- Choose better tools to develop the landing page. custom css to style the page and font awesome to display the social media icons ( facebook, instagram and tweeter icons) selected.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### What I learned

I took the opportunity to learn some new tools. I learned to add social media icons and/or any icons that have classic styles such as solid, regular, light, ... by using font awesome package.

### Useful resources

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
